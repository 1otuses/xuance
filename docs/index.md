# Welcome to XuanPolicy

**XuanPolicy** is an open-source ensemble of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm implementations.

We call it as **Xuan-Ce (玄策)** in Chinese. 
"**Xuan (玄)**" means incredible and magic box, "**Ce (策)**" means policy.

DRL algorithms are sensitive to hyper-parameters tuning, varying in performance with different tricks,
and suffering from unstable training processes, therefore, sometimes DRL algorithms seems elusive and "Xuan". 
This project gives a thorough, high-quality and easy-to-understand implementation of DRL algorithms, 
and hope this implementation can give a hint on the magics of reinforcement learning.

We expect it to be compatible with multiple deep learning toolboxes(
**[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**, 
**[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)**, and 
**[MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/en)**),
and hope it can really become a zoo full of DRL algorithms.
