Robotic Warehouse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Robotic Warehouse is an MARL environment often used to simulate warehouse automation scenarios.
It serves as a testbed for studying cooperative, competitive, and mixed interaction among multiple agents, such as robots.
The environment is designed to model tasks commonly found in real-world warehouses,
such as navigation, item retrieval, obstacle avoidance, and task allocation.
