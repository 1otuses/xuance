# Gymnasium

Gymnasium is a community-driven toolkit for DRL, 
developed as an enhanced and actively maintained fork of 
[OpenAI's Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) by the [Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/). 
It provides a standardized interface for building and benchmarking DRL algorithms while addressing the limitations of the original Gym. 
Gymnasium retains backward compatibility with Gym while introducing significant improvements to modernize the toolkit.
